- 👋 Hi, I’m Patricia Soto @PatSoto-BioPhys
- 👀 I’m interested in modeling how amyloid fibrils induce toxicity. Our primary interest is the prion protein. On my other research, I am interested in developing pedagogical strategies to scaffold the development of scientific computing skills of undergraduates.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning different coarse graining approaches of proteins, lipids, and water molecules.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on meshing wet lab biophysical data with our simulations. 
- 📫 How to reach me: patriciasoto@creighton.edu
